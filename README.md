# ACNH-Pixel-Press

ACNH tool to draw a given image on the bulletin board. It requires a Nintendo Switch running custom firmware with [sys-botbase 1.8](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase).

## How to use

1) Go in front of the bulletin board.
2) Create a post and select your brush size. Thinnest brush has the best results.
4) Type in your IP address and press connect.
5) Load the image by pressing on the image button.
6) Press draw.

## Warning
The ink is limited, so it's better to select a picture with a lot of bright/white background. It will keep trying to draw even if the ink is empty.

## Discord help server
If you run into problems, you can ask for help in the Hangout HQ Discord server.
